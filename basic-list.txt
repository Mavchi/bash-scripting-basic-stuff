- Listinig files and directories (ls)
	ls -la
	-a do not ignore entries starting with .
	-l use a long listing format
- pwd
	prints the current working directory
- cd
	The cd command is used to move around in the directory structure of the file system
	cd ~ or simply cd changes your working directory to your home directory.
	cd / changes your working directory to root folder.
	cd . keep you in your working directory, i.e. single dot (.) refers to your current directory.
	cd .. changes your working directory to one level up, i.e. to parent directory.
	cd - changes your working directory to previous working directory, useful when jumping between two directories.
- mkdir
	The mkdir command creates directories.
	-p creates the specified parent directories for a new directory if they do not already 
	exist
	-m controls the permission mode of new directories (in the same way as chmod)
- rmdir 
	The rmdir command is used to remove empty directories.
	-p remove  DIRECTORY  and  its ancestors; e.g., 'rmdir -p a/b/c' is
              similar to 'rmdir a/b/c a/b a'
- touch 
	Creates empty file in specified directories
- cp
	The cp command is used to copy files or directories.
	- cp [options] source destination : Copy files and directories
	- For example: to make a copy of the file foo.txt and to call it foo-2.txt we would 
	enter the following;
		cp foo.txt foo-2.txt
	-r (also works with -R) allows us to copy directories and their contents recursivly. In other
	words we can copy the directory, its file and subdirectories ad infinitum.
	-p preserves the mode, ownership and timestamps of copied files
	-u updates copied files by only copying the file when the source file is newer than the
	destination file or when the destination file is missing
	To copy all the files from directory1 to directory2;
		cp directory1/* directory2/
	To copy all the files and subdirectories from directory1 to directory2;
		cp -r directory1/* directory2/
	To copy the files foo.txt and bar.txt to the directory foobar;
		cp foo.txt bar.txt foobar/
	To copy all the ‘txt’ files from the users home directory to a directory called backup;
		cp ~/*.txt backup/
- Manual pages (man)
	-k 	Search short descriptions and page names with a keyword. 	 man -k copy
	-w 	Print the location(s) of manual pages. 	 man -w cp
	-f 	Print the short description of any found command. 	 man -f cp
- Useful shotkeys on ubuntu
	ctrl+alt+t opens terminal on ubuntu
	ctrl+alt+left/right changes workspace
	ctrl+l Can be used to clear the terminal screen. It's an equivalent of running command clear.
	Ctrl + C Sometimes it is useful to interrupt process
	Ctrl + Z Process can also be suspended if needed
	(bg and especially fg are important when suspending in text mode. Especially when using text editors)
- Patterns and wildcards
	Wildcard patterns, also known as globbing (man 7 glob)
	For example, cp *.{png, gif} my/images/, will copy all png and gif -files from the current working directory to images directory.
  Here’s a list of the most commonly used wildcards :
	Wildcard Matches
	* zero or more characters
	? exactly one character
	[abcde] exactly one of the characters listed
	[a-e] exactly one character in the range specified
	[!abcde] any character that is not listed
	[!a-e] any character that is not in the range specified
	{pi,raspberry} exactly one entire word from the options given
